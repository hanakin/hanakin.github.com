                    Its been several years since the release of midaym.com back in 2009. Since then I have gone through countless desings/concepts for what I wanted the site to be. Ulltimately it was the easy of fitting the designs to the backend that was discouraging/preventing a release until now, trying to create hack after hack to enable even the smallest of feature to work with wordpress. This time around I went with an all new approach. I am using a simplified ruby gem called Jekyll to server everything using markdown.
