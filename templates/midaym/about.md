### Who Am I
I am a Front-End Web Designer & Developer. I live on the road, coding & designing amazing things for the web. O and ocassionally I stop what I am working on to write & share on this blog.

### My Specialties
I specialize in the creation of the Front-End of Web Development. The look, Feel, & Presences for a Site or App. I leverage semantic [HTML5][3] markup & Expressive yet Responsive [CSS][4], coupled with Creative Elegant Designs. Add in a little flavour with some [jQuery][5] to polish it all off.

I also have apassion for the Back-End Development utilizing [PHP][6]. This site is actually being served to you by a [PHP][6] app called [Dropplets][1] which I modified to suit my needs. This allows me to easily upload Markdown files for all my posts thus eliviating all the mus & fus of a traditional Blog applications such as [Wordpress][2].
